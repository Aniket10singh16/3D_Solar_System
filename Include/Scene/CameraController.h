/**
 * @file CameraController.h
 * @brief Declares the CameraController class for mapping input → camera updates.
 *
 * The CameraController is the "brain":
 *  - Reads input state (keyboard/mouse) via Input system
 *  - Translates input into movement and rotation commands
 *  - Calls Camera.Move / Camera.Rotate appropriately
 *
 * This design keeps Camera clean and reusable,
 * while CameraController encapsulates user-control logic.
